# Coding Assignment Solution

This repository contains assignments from a Machine Learning course, completed as part of my PhD program in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI).
It is intended to serve as a reference for learners. Students are encouraged to use it as guidance and develop their own solutions rather than copying directly.

Course: ML By Prof. Chaklam Silpasuwanchai, TA Akraradet Sinsamersuk
