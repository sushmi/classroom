# Coding Assignment Solution

This repository contains assignments from a Machine Learning course, completed as part of my PhD program in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI).
It is intended to serve as a reference for learners. Students are encouraged to use it as guidance and develop their own solutions rather than copying directly.

Course: ML By Prof. Chaklam Silpasuwanchai, TA Akraradet Sinsamersuk

## Coding Assignment A1

1. [README](README_A1.md)
2. [Solution python notebook](notebooks/A1%20-%20Predicting%20Car%20Prices.ipynb)
3. [Problem Statement](assignments/A1__Predicting_Car_Price.pdf)
4. [HTML Export](outputs/A1%20-%20Predicting%20Car%20Prices.html)
5. [Data set](data/Cars.csv)


# Coding Environment

## Use .devcontainer
1. Install Devcontainer plugin using Package manager
2. Intall Docker and Docker Desktop or Orbstack 
3. Once you install Dev Container, you will see .devcontainer folder created with devcontainer.json
4. For this project, python is managed under .devcontainer/python. Alternatively you can use base image with python installed. Let's work with the current setup, as this help to control python version separately.
